# Mission Control: AI Agent Fleet Manager

**Mission Control** is a "Command Center" application designed to manage a squad of autonomous AI agents. Unlike typical "Chat with AI" apps, this system treats agents as **independent workers** that can collaborate, chat, and execute complex tasks in the background.

## 🌟 Why This Exists
Evaluating AI agents individually is slow. Mission Control provides a **Squad Interface** to:
1.  **Visualize** what agents are doing in real-time.
2.  **Orchestrate** complex missions (breaking them down into tickets).
3.  **Collaborate** via a "War Room" where humans and agents talk on equal footing.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **The Dashboard**: A glassmorphic UI to see activity feeds, agent status (Idle/Working), and mission boards.
- **The War Room**: A multi-agent chat interface where Jarvis, Shuri, and you can brainstorm.
- **Atomic Task Management**: A Kanban board where agents "Claim" tickets, work on them, and submit results.
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Multiple agents (with different Personalities/SOULs) running in parallel, reacting to the same context.
