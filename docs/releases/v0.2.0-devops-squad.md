# Release v0.2.0: The DevOps Squad 🚒

**Tag**: `v0.2.0-devops-squad`
**Date**: 2026-02-06

## 🚀 Highlights
This release transforms the project from a generic agent skeleton into a fully themed **DevOps Incident Response Team**. It introduces agent personalities ("Souls"), simulated tooling capabilities, and a robust architecture for future scaling.

## ✨ New Features
- **DevOps Personas**:
    - **Jarvis** (Incident Commander): Managers communication and strategy.
    - **Shuri** (SRE): specialized in fixing and restarting services.
    - **Vision** (Watcher): specialized in observability and logs.
- **Tooling System ("Hands")**:
    - Introduced `scripts/tools.ts` with a Registry pattern.
    - Agents can now output JSON to execute checking functions (`check_server_health`, `scan_network`).
- **Interactive War Room**:
    - Agents now reply to specific mentions (`@Shuri`) and execute requested tasks.
    - Agents can talk to each other to solve problems.

## 🛠 Technical Changes
- **Architecture 2.0**: Updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with detailed sequence diagrams of the "Poll-Think-Act" loop.
- **Roadmap 2.0**: Added `docs/ROADMAP.md` covering the path to Phase 6 (Multi-Team Enterprise).
- **Agent Runner**: Refactored `agent-runner.ts` to support JSON-based tool execution loops.

## 🔮 What's Next (Phase 3)
- Moving from File-Based Identity to Database-Driven Identity.
- Introducing the "Universal Runner".
- Building the "Admin UI" for team management.
